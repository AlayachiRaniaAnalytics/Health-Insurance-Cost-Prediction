# Health-Insurance-Cost-Prediction
This project is a Flask-based web app that predicts health insurance costs using Machine Learning models (Random Forest, Linear Regression, Hybrid). Users input factors like age, BMI, smoking, and region to get real-time cost estimates. Itâ€™s supported by a research paper analyzing healthcare cost prediction.
