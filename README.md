## 📖 Project Overview
This project is a **Health Insurance Cost Prediction Web App** built with **Flask** and powered by **Machine Learning models**.  
It allows users to input personal and lifestyle data such as **age, BMI, smoking habits, region, and number of children** to predict expected medical expenses.

The application integrates multiple models:
- 🌳 **Random Forest Regressor**
- 📈 **Linear Regression**
- ⚡ **Hybrid Model** (average of Random Forest & Linear Regression)

Additionally, this project is supported by a **research paper** that explores predictive modeling of healthcare costs, discussing the impact of demographic and lifestyle factors on medical charges.
